## Contribution

### Build
1. Install dependencies.
```
npm install
```
2. Generate bundle file by webpack.
```
webpack
```
3. Open index.html by a browser. I prefer to use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to host it and open at localhost:8080, in order to use react-devtools on Chrome.
